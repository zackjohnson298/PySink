BasicS - The AsyncWorker
========================

In this example, you will see how to start an :class:`~PySink.AsyncWorker`, create a new worker with a custom task, define a custom
:class:`result<PySink.AsyncWorkerResults>` type for your worker, and define custom :class:`signals<PySink.AsyncWorkerSignals>` that your worker can emit. The output of these workers will
print to the terminal for now. In :ref:`later examples<example-1>`, you will see how to use an :class:`~PySink.AsyncWorker` within a
full PySide6 application, but first let's start with the basics:
