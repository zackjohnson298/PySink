Overview
========

PySink is an extension of the PySide6 Qt Framework that simplifies the implementation
of Asynchronous tasks in Desktop Applications. It contains several
helper Widgets and Classes that enable you to build powerful and professional
desktop applications without worrying about managing threads or freezing up the
UI with long-running tasks. PySink's implementation suggests an MVC
architecture for your application, but should perform well in other architectures
such as MVVM.
